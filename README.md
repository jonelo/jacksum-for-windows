# Jacksum for Windows

Jacksum for Windows is an installation program with which you can easily access functions of [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) on Microsoft Windows.

The installation program installs

- [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) which is the hash engine, it also provides the command line interface (CLI)
- [HashGarten](https://github.com/jonelo/HashGarten) which is a standalone graphical user interface (GUI) for Jacksum
- script glue to call Jacksum and HashGarten from your preferred file manager
- an uninstallation program to restore the changes again

## Requirements

### Hardware

  * Processor with x64 chip set
  * 128 MiB free RAM
  * 150 MiB free disk space

### Software

  * Microsoft Windows 10 or 11
  * Microsoft File Explorer or one of the supported file browsers below

#### Supported File Managers

Any file manager that supports the Microsoft Windows Standard **Send To**-Interface is fully supported by the installer.

> [!TIP]
> If your preferred file manager does not support "Send to", chances are high that your file manager supports at least **drag & drop**, so you could use drag & drop to transfer file/directory-paths from your file manager to the HashGarten GUI where you can process data further, e.g. calculate hashes from file/directory-paths.

The following file managers have been tested successfully to work with Jacksum and HashGarten:

## Download

Go to the [Download Page](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-for-windows/releases/latest) and download the .zip file which contains a precompiled executable for Microsoft Windows.
You also find official hashes in the release notes.

## Installation

Just extract the .zip file and double-click on the executable called `Jacksum for Windows.exe`.
Allow Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to start the app. I didn't sign the app, because it would require a fee for me.
Before you execute the app you should verify the official hash values to make sure you have obtained the executable from a reliable source. The hash values are available on the [download page](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-fbi-windows/releases/latest) or on the [Jacksum homepage](https://jacksum.net/en/download.html).

The installer installs the JRE 21 LTS, Jacksum, and HashGarten to your homedirectory under the folder `Jacksum for Windows`. The environment variable called
JACKSUM_HOME is set with the value of the installation folder, and it is added to the user's PATH, so you can also launch Jacksum just by typing `jacksum` on the command line if you want to.

You can launch the installer as often as you want.

After successful installation a dialog box informs you what have been done.

## Usage

> [!TIP]
> The installer does not only integrate Jacksum and HashGarten to your File Browser, and makes it accessible for the start menu, it also allows you to call Jacksum from the command line or call HashGarten as standalone app.

### As Standalone Application

Click on the Window search menu and type "HashGarten" to find the app

![explorer_RTUC1bXfNb](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-fbi-windows/assets/10409423/1df6af33-2925-45de-a52a-0eb96c235040)

or go to the installation folder called `Jacksum for Windows` which is located under your home directory and double-click on the `.jar` file that is prefixed by `HashGarten`.

> [!TIP]
> If double click on the HashGarten jar does not work, just call [Jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html).


### From your File Manager

On Windows 11, select files and directories, hold down the shift key when you right-click with your mouse and select "Send to".
On Windows 10, select files and directories, right click with your mouse and select "Send to".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonelo/jacksum-fbi-windows/main/docs/images/sendto-de.png" alt="Send to screenshot" style="vertical-align:top;margin:10px 10px" />

After a menu item has been selected from the "Send to" menu, [HashGarten](https://github.com/jonelo/HashGarten) resp. [Jacksum](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum) take over.

## Customization

You can modify the batch (just select item 4 at the Send To menu) if the default customized format does not meet your need or if you use a different editor rather than the Windows Notepad.

## Uninstallation

Go to Program and Features, search for "HashGarten" and select Uninstallation from the dots-menu.

![ApplicationFrameHost_mMKeJAoU6f](https://github.com/jonelo/jacksum-for-windows/assets/10409423/c68621e1-f24b-46ac-a2ae-4472cf971e08)

Alternatively, go to the `Jacksum for Windows` folder in your home directory, you will find the `uninstall.exe`.

The uninstallation program removes Jacksum and HashGarten entirely from your disk.

## Developer Hints

The installer called `sendto.nsi` is written in NSIS. You need the [NSIS Compiler](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) to compile .nsi to an .exe.
